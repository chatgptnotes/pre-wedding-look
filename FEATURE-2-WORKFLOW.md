# Feature-2 Autonomous Development Workflow

## 🚀 Quick Start

This worktree is configured for **autonomous development** - no user confirmation needed.

### Current Setup
- **Branch:** `feature/game-enhancements`
- **Upstream:** `origin/feature/game-enhancements`
- **Auto-commit:** Enabled via script and npm commands

## 📝 Development Commands

### Start Development
```bash
cd "/Users/murali/Dating app v2/pre-wedding-look/.trees/feature-2"
npm run dev  # Auto-assigns port (usually 5174)
```

### Quick Commit & Push
```bash
# Auto-commit with default message
npm run commit

# Auto-commit with custom message
./auto-commit.sh "feat: your custom message here"

# Or use npm script with message
npm run commit:msg -- "feat: your custom message"
```

### Development Cycle
1. **Make changes** to any files
2. **Test locally** with `npm run dev`
3. **Auto-commit** with `npm run commit`
4. **Changes automatically pushed** to `origin/feature/game-enhancements`

## 🔄 Automated Workflow

### What Happens Automatically
- ✅ `git add .` - Stages all changes
- ✅ Commits with descriptive message + Claude Code attribution
- ✅ `git push origin feature/game-enhancements` - Pushes to remote
- ✅ Progress logging and confirmation

### No Manual Git Required
The `auto-commit.sh` script handles:
- Staging changes
- Commit message formatting
- Pushing to correct branch
- Error handling

## 🎯 Feature-2 Focus: Game Enhancements

Recommended development areas for this worktree:
- **Multiplayer Features:** Room management, real-time updates
- **Game Mechanics:** Scoring, timer, round management
- **Player Experience:** Avatars, animations, feedback

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production  
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run commit       # Quick commit & push
./auto-commit.sh     # Manual commit with custom message
```

## 📊 Current Status

- **Worktree:** Active and configured
- **Branch tracking:** Set up with origin
- **Auto-push:** Enabled
- **Dependencies:** Installed and ready

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Port Conflicts
If port 5174 is busy:
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 5175
```

### Script Permissions
If auto-commit.sh fails:
```bash
chmod +x auto-commit.sh
```

### Reset Branch
If needed to sync with main:
```bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
```

## 🎉 Ready for Development!

This worktree is fully configured for autonomous development. Make changes, test locally, and use `npm run commit` to automatically push to the feature branch.
